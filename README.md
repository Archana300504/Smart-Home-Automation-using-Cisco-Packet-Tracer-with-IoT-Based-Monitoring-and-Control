# Smart-Home-Automation-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-with-IoT-Based-Monitoring-and-Control

The Smart Home Automation System in Cisco Packet Tracer works by integrating IoT devices with a Home Gateway, allowing remote monitoring and control through wired/wireless communication protocols such as Zigbee & Wi-Fi. The system enables automation of various home appliances like lights, fans, ACs, doors, motion sensors, sirens, and temperature monitors.

# IoT Device Integration

1. Various IoT-enabled devices such as smart lights, fans, doors, ACs, and motion sensors are connected to a Home Gateway.
2. The Home Gateway acts as a central hub, facilitating communication between IoT devices and external networks.

# Network Configuration

1. The Wireless Router connects the Home Gateway and IoT devices using Wi-Fi or Zigbee protocols.
2. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) assigns IP addresses to all devices, ensuring seamless communication.

# Data Collection & Processing

1. Sensors (e.g., motion detectors and temperature sensors) continuously monitor the environment and send real-time data to the Home Gateway.
2. The collected data is processed, and appropriate actions are triggered based on predefined automation rules.

# Remote Access & Control

1. The IoT Monitor App on a smartphone allows users to remotely monitor and control devices through the Home Gateway.
2. A Web Server is configured to enable web-based remote access, where users can control devices from a browser.

# Communication Using Zigbee & MQTT

1. Zigbee is used for short-range, low-power communication between IoT devices.
2. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) enables cloud-based communication, ensuring real-time updates and remote control.
3. Automation & Alerts
4. Devices are programmed to function automatically based on sensor data.
5. Example: If motion is detected, the lights turn on automatically and a siren is triggered if unauthorized access is detected.
6. Temperature sensors regulate AC operation based on ambient conditions.
7. Power Management & Security
8. The system ensures energy efficiency by turning off devices when not in use.
9. Security features such as smart door locks, motion detection, and sirens
10. enhance safety by detecting unauthorized access and sending alerts
